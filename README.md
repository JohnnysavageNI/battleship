## Game Play

The game begins with the user deciding the grid size by inputting one number so it'll be a square grid. This can be any size as long as it's at least 2, choosing 1 will result in an error message. 

The player must input 2 numbers separated by a comma and numbers must not be larger than the grid size otherwise they will get an error message.

If the user is one number away from the ship they'll get a message saying they're really close. This will help the game be more engaging creating a sense of excitement and focus knowing they were close.

The player has 5 attempts to find the ship otherwise the game is over.
